# Timer Application
Just a simple playground example using Laravel, Backbone.js and CoffeeScript.

## Application outline
- Users should be able to track time slips. Single slips should be saved to a MySQL database with a description and a duration in seconds. 
- There should also be an all time spent view.

## Road Map
- I'd like to be able to create project. Projects should contain time slips and total time.
- I'd like to add swipe-to-delete functionality to timeslips

## Got any feedback?
This is my first attempt with Laravel, so I'm likely to do stupid things. If you catch anything I'd love if you'd let me know.

â€¦ Have a nice day :)
